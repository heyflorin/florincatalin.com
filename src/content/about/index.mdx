  - title: Work Philosophy
    description: Every day, as a designer, I have an opportunity to form ideas, products, and solutions in a way that brings new possibilities and positivity into people's lives. As an engineer, I can bring those ideas to life and deliver them directly into the hands of users at scale. I respect and appreciate these opportunities and I constantly refine how I approach new problems to ensure that I take advantage of them with every project I touch.

        I partner with stakeholders and empathize with users to define the desired outcome according to their needs. I ask questions, question assumptions, and immerse myself in the problem space. I identify key metrics in order to measure and scale.
      name: Understand
    - description: >-
        I exhaust design options early to minimize the cost of change and reduce the risk of rework. I prototype, validate, and iterate, staying close to the user. I leverage patterns and design systems to establish and maintain a consistent design language.

    - description: >-
        I refine, implement, and test with real users against assumptions, hypotheses, and defined metrics. I curate and reinforce design artifacts and reusable components. I assess and adjust for future iterations, incorporate feedback, and continue monitoring.

Iâ€™ve been building websites and applications for the last 7 years as a hybrid UX Designer and Front-End Engineer. I've worked with various clients across a wide array of industries in both B2B and B2C contexts. I've helped ship complex products for startups, non-profits, agencies, and enterprise-level companies. Currently, I'm building and leading a UI/UX practice at [**Blueprint Technologies**](https://bpcs.com), a technical services and software product company. I'm passionate about leveraging and expanding my technical expertise in both engineering and human-centered design to build more accessible, usable, and reliable digital products.
