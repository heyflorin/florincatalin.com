  Conduit is a lightweight data virtualization tool that allows organizations to unlock the hidden value of their data. The product enables real-time analytics with high speed queries for a variety of data sources. As the product matured, users wanted the ability to annotate, discover, and explore disparate datasets. Several initiatives kicked off in tandem, including the addition of two major features and a UI overhaul.

  - title: Design Problems Identified
    component: Understand
    description: Existing customers have long asked for a query and semantic layer to perform data modeling and preparation for reporting, analytics, and data science work. Additionally, current and prospective customers wanted a way to curate and manage valuable data assets created by the product, and the current version didn't provide this functionality. Competitors however, did. Lastly, increased failures in newly implemented user acceptance testing by lighthouse customers showed breakdowns in earlier builds of the product at the UI level. Notably, the navigation and IA was leading to confusion for analysts.

  - title: Market Research & Engagement
    component: Understand
    description: With the help of another Product Manager, I researched the product landscape in various spaces adjacent to data virualization including data integration, data quality, and data governance. I canvassed six product offerings and gained insight on common patterns, use cases, problem areas and opportunities.

  - title: Validating The User's Needs
    component: Understand
    description: In order to validate and empathize with the user's needs, we conducted interviews with 11 existing users of the product and attempted map their reponses to use cases discovered from market research. Through these interviews, we identified a unique opportunity to narrow the scope of our feature-set. Participants reported that the semantic layer and deep modeling capabilities of larger platforms were cumbersome, overly-complex, and often did not justify the price tag. To dig deeper, we ran a card sort survey to surface high priority features.

  - title: Personas & Their Journeys
    component: Understand
    description: Once our team synthesized the data from the user interviews and surveys, I drafted 3 user personas which were validated by our end users and team. In the end we narrowed the scope into two personas. These personas informed the creation of user journey maps, which were ultimately presented to the leadership team for final approval.

  - title: Wireframe Rounds
    component: Explore
    description: One of the guiding principles for building products at Blueprint is to engage the users, stakeholders, and subject matter experts early and often. After drafting three separate sets of wireframes, we introduced them into our feedback loop with pilot users. This continued for three rounds, each surfacing valuable insights through direct comments and feedback. The first set focused on the features relating to the data catalog, which was the most timely, but we found it valuable to engage our users for all three streams, including the query editor and a revamped UI.

  - title: High Fidelity Prototyping
    component: Explore
    description: Once validated, the approved wireframes were referenced to create re-usable high fidelity prototypes in Figma. Critical interactions such as search, endpoint checkout, multi-object selection, and bulk editing were also mapped and prototyped. This served dual purpose for user validation and engineer handoff, which was all facilitated by Figma's prototype viewer and design inspector. Design redlines were conducted throughout the course of the development's agile sprint process.

  - title: Revamped User Interface
    component: Materialize
    description: In parallel with the data catalog and query editor designs, our team was tasked with designing and developing an MVP for Conduit that included an improved IA, user flow, and a modern, dark UI that was decoupled from the Material design system. I took the same approach for prototyping. After the wireframes we're approved, the design took a vastly different approach for not only the data catalog, but for a brand new connector wizard; inspired by early sketches that heavily resonated with stakeholders and users. I led the design and development team to deliver a working proof of concept in less than a month. The app was decoupled from the back end and a working demo was presented to the leadership team at Blueprint.

  - title: Viable Data Catalog
    component: Materialize
    description: The research showed that feature-sets for data catalog products can balloon to platform level. It was important for our engineering team to prioritize the most viable features for our paying customers and partners. The catalog was developed in three phases and due to our roadmap prioritization we were able to pay close attention to specific interactions that were of most value to the user, like annotation and search. As a result, our 2.0 release was regarded as a huge hit to both our customers and our executive team.

  - title: Next Generation Conduit
    component: Materialize
    description: Our team set out not only to unlock the next stage of growth for the product, but to explore a complete overhaul of its user experience. A video showcasing the new features and UI was shown across the company and the prototype was wrapped into a deployable demo for an external audience. Our team has continued to gather and quantify feedback in preparation for moving full speed on the next generation design and development in Q4.
