  Workplace Analytics uses data from everyday work in Microsoft 365 to identify collaboration patterns that impact productivity, workforce effectiveness, and employee engagement. This massive amount of data is often untapped and is incredibly valuable. Microsoft sought to leverage this data to create an accurate footprint of how individuals within an organization collaborate, identify communication breakdowns and siloes, and create actionable insights for strategic leaders.

  - title: Aligning to the Hypothesis
    component: Understand
    description: When I joined the team, the core hypothesis was already defined. Previous research identified the problem as an analytical disconnect between disparate employee collaboration tools. Notably, there was no easy and effective way to collect, manage, and analyze data across all of these sources. The employee experience was directly correlated to productivity and performance and was a focal point in addressing this problem. Our tool was hypothesized to bridge the gap between various collaboration datasets and bring fast, actionable insights to the user through an intuitive user interface.

  - title: The Employee Experience
    component: Understand
    description: I worked with our design and research team to formulate common scenarios around the employee experience. We started by defining the high-level touchpoints in the overarching journey and added a dimension of emotions experienced throughout the employee lifecycle. Finally, we filled in the rest of the map with commonly occurring events, reactions, and feelings. This helped us get a better sense of what we were attempting to solve with this tool.

  - title: User Interaction Flow
    component: Explore
    description: As our team received requests for new features, and when completing each feature build, the lead designer and I would break the user tasks down and assess where each fits into the overall user interaction flow. This diagram helped us ask detailed questions about the goals of our users before adding complexity to the rest of the product.

  - title: Starting With Low Fidelity
    component: Explore
    description: Low fidelity wireframes were instrumental in refining and validating user requirements; which often came in fast and unfiltered. This helped our UX team and Product Managers pass more signal to the engineering team, rather than noise. This exercise was particularly useful to me as a hybrid designer/developer and it increased the speed and accuracy with which we delivered features.

  - title: Improving & Evolving the UI
    component: Materialize
    description: The initial build of the user interface was technically functional, but lacked context, affordances, helpful tooltips, and advanced controls. The tool displayed metrics and measures that were unfamiliar to even the most technical analysts, and the customer team reported that users felt like it was a tool built by Data Scientists for Data Scientists. We set out to build a more intuitive UI, added a dark mode, helpful coach marks and tooltips, and advanced controls. My role involved early UX design and leading UI implementation.

  - title: Network Insights & Advanced Controls
    component: Materialize
    description: A common request from our user interviews was for the ability to actually “see” their organization’s communication habits. I worked with our Data Science team and our Lead UX Designer to prototype and implement an interactive network graph that shows every person within an organization, and who they communicate with via Microsoft Office communication tools. The UI allows for the analyst to color their network based on specific human resource attributes, so they can focus their analysis on their specific areas of interest. It also gives metrics relevant to data-driven managers on their organization’s stability, connectivity, and cohesion, without having to decipher more complicated data tables.

  - title: Communication Flow
    component: Materialize
    description: Communication Flow gives managers and analysts the ability to categorize all of their organization’s meetings and emails into buckets using topic modeling and natural language processing. I worked with designers and product managers to design and implement a tool that gives users the ability to focus on specific groups of an organization like roles or departments, and which topics are of interest. The network graph that is generated shows links based on the categories selected, and allows the user to scrub to a specific time range.

  - title: Ensuring Performance With Graph Settings
    component: Materialize
    description: A big challenge we ran into was maintaining consistent browser performance, which involved reducing edge-occlusion on the graph. We often had to choose between limiting the product's capability versus increasing the complexity of the user experience. One way we were able to ensure performance was to design the graph controls in a way that guided the user to select more reasonable amounts of data to analyze and graph. We accomplished this by creating clear and intuitively grouped controls. We also allowed the user to save graphs once they achieved a useful configuration and allowed them to edit the settings of saved graphs.
    sectionimage:

      caption: We interviewed existing users to identify which grouping attributes were used most often, and limited the amount to 5 in order to maintain a performant graph.

  - title: Results & Impact
    description: The product started as an initial MVP and evolved into a full-fledged custom solution offered to Microsoft's largest enterprise clients. The tool was deployed to over 25 large-scale customers. What began as an experiment has evolved into a valuable offering that gives organizations the visibility to increase the employee experience and thus, performance and productivity. The product continues to garner positive feedback and has a full backlog of feature requests.
