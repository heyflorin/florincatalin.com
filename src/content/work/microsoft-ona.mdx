  Workplace Analytics uses data from everyday work in Microsoft 365 to identify collaboration patterns that impact productivity, workforce effectiveness, and employee engagement. This massive amount of data is often untapped and is incredibly valuable. Microsoft saught to leverage this data to create an accurate footprint of how individuals within an organization actually collaborate, identify communication break-downs and siloes, and create actionable insights for strategic leaders.

  - title: Aligning to the Hypothesis
    component: Understand
    description: When I joined the team, the core hypothesis had been defined. Research identified the problem as an analytical disconnect between disparate employee collaboration tools. Notably, there was no easy and effective way to collect, manage, and analyze data across all of these source. The employee experience was directly correlated to productivity and performance and was a focal point in adressing this problem. Our tool was hypothesized to bridge the gap between various collaboration datasets and bring fast, actional insights to the user through an intuitive user interface.

  - title: The Employee Experience
    component: Understand
    description: I worked with our design and research team to formulate common scenarios around the employee experience. We started by defining the high level touch points in the overarching journey, and added a dimension of emotions experienced throughout the experience lifecycle. Finally, we filled in the rest of the map with commonly occuring events, reactions, and feelings. This helped us get a better sense of what we were attempting to solve with this tool.

  - title: User Interaction Flow
    component: Explore
    description: As each feature of the product was being built, the lead UX designer and I would break the user tasks down and assess where each task fit into the overall user flow. This diagram helped us ask detailed questions about the goals of our user, before adding complexity to the rest of the product.

  - title: Starting With Low Fidelity
    component: Explore
    description: As requests came in for new features, low fidelity wireframes were pivotal in refining and validating user requirements; which often came in fast and unfiltered. This helped our UX team and Product Managers pass signal to the engineering team, rather than noise. This excercise was particularly useful as a hybrid designer/developer and increased the speed and accuracy with which we delivered features.

  - title: Improving & Evolving the Experience
    component: Materlialize
    description: The intial build of the user interface was technically functional, but lacked context, affordances, tooltips, and controls. The tool displayed metrics and measures that were unfamiliar to even the most technical analyists, and the customer team reported that users felt like it was a tool built by Data Scientists for Data Scientists. We set out to build a more intuitive UI, with an added dark mode, helpful dialogs, and advanced controls.

  - title: Results & Impact
    description: The virtual photobooth continued the tradition of unexpected creative execution. The Snapchat-esque photobooth experience and customized photobooth props and photo sharing/saving features were well received by Schwabe's clients, garnering favorable feedback and engagement. The interactive greeting won a dotCOMM Award for Interactive Capabilities in the Website Creativity category.
