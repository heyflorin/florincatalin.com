  title: Happy Holidays from Schwabe
description: >-
  One of the largest law firms in the region was looking for a creative partner to continue an award-winning annual holiday tradition. My team was tasked to take this tradition to the next level, complete with a blank canvas and few constraints.

  - title: Brainstorming
    component: Understand
    description: We held a series of brainstorming sessions taking into account key self and client-imposed goals. We wanted to encourage social media engagement while maintaining the user's sense of privacy. We wanted Schwabe's customer's to feel appreciated and thanked. Finally, we wanted to create a delightful and memorable experience for all recipients of the digital card.

  - title: Everybody Loves a Photobooth
    component: Understand
    description: With the popularity of Snapchat and Instagram filters, we found an opportunity to engage our users uniquely; by using browser-based face tracking we would transform our user's webcams into a digital photobooth. We researched various tracking platforms and libraries, landing on a ThreeJS based SDK called "BRFv4." The idea was pitched to the client and soon after sign-off we licensed the software and got to work.

  - title: User Flow & Wireframe
    component: Explore
    description: Our team explored three rounds of concepts with our stakeholders and landed on a final user flow accompanied by a mid-fidelity wireframe. From there I developed a proof of concept and technical demo which solidified the viability of the core idea.

  - title: Building The Application
    component: Materialize
    description: Illustrations were provided by our creative director in PNG format. Each prop was then mapped to a 3D canvas before being imported into the core project. The application was built using Vue.js and is compatible with most modern browsers and a variety of devices with cameras. The interaction flow consisted of an initial splash screen, the photobooth screen, and a save/share screen.

  - title: User Testing
    component: Materialize
    description: Testing efforts initially focused on the core camera experience. Specifically, performance, tracking & detection of edge cases, accessibility, and device compatibility. Initial feedback was overwhelmingly positive and our initial MVP became the basis of the final product. Next, we focused on testing the photo saving and sharing experience.

  - title: Results & Impact
    description: The virtual photobooth continued the tradition of unexpected creative execution. The Snapchat-esque photobooth experience and customized photobooth props and photo sharing/saving features were well received by Schwabe's clients, garnering favorable feedback and engagement. The interactive greeting won a dotCOMM Award for Interactive Capabilities in the Website Creativity category.
