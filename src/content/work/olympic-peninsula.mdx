  title: Olympic Peninsula – Official Travel & Tourism Site
description: >-
  The Olympic Peninsula Tourism Commission is tasked with marketing the entire Olympic Peninsula, including 25 destinations across 8 city and regional partners. Their website was almost a decade old, included a complicated back-end, and relied on a community-driven content base that was difficult to manage. The partnership was ready to recast their presentation less like a collection of database entries and more like an engaging and inspiring digital magazine.

  - title: Road Trips & Workshops
    component: Understand
    description: To empathize and align with our users, the team organized a multi-stop road trip to the Olympic Peninsula. Our journey began with a planning and research session and ended with a creative workshop at the Visitor Bureau’s headquarters. This set the stage for a clear picture of our target personas.

  - title: Mapping The Journey
    component: Understand
    description: Individual and group visitors were targeted as the primary audience. Existing research conducted by the client found that visitors looking at the Olympic Peninsula were viewing it in the context of a visit to the Seattle metro area. Industry professionals were considered a secondary persona and included travel industry representatives like media, government agencies, film companies, and local tourism businesses.

  - title: Mapping The Site
    component: Understand
    description: I collaborated with the content team and stakeholders on three iterations of the proposed site map. My responsibility included information hierarchy and architecture which was illustrated by this artifact. After several revisions, the document was sign-off on. It served as a guideline and a mechanism to communicate project progress to the client.

  - title: Low to High Fidelity
    component: Explore
    description: I started with low fidelity wireframes to demonstrate overall site structure, responsive layout strategy, and to elicit initial feedback. In the second and third rounds, InVision was used to highlight interactions and gather more detailed feedback from the stakeholders and validate the high-level information hierarchy.

  - title: Giving Regional Context to the User
    component: Materialize
    description: A quantitative Likert survey we conducted showed that visitors (especially the Seattle market) believe the Peninsula is hard to get to. We proposed a simplified interactive map coupled with a branding strategy (calling it a "loop"). The final implemented design allowed users to maintain a high-level context of the entire region while drilling down to specific quadrants or destinations.

  - title: Intuitive Workflow to Empower Users
    component: Materialize
    description: A streamlined library for "things to do" on the Peninsula was presented in a hierarchical format. This allows the user to explore the directory while maintaining contextual awareness. The card component inherits and solidifies a pattern established throughout the website for listings and maintains UI consistency.

  - title: Filterable Listings Enhanced With TripAdvisor
    component: Materialize
    description: For our users, one of the most important aspects of planning a trip was booking a hotel. We also found that amenities were of particular interest when narrowing down options. For these reasons, we included stackable filters while also building in alphabetical grouping to even the playing field for the Visitor Bureau's partners. Each card pulled in data automatically using TripAdvisor's API.

  - title: Story-Driven Page Templates
    component: Materialize
    description: Consistency in the presentation of content was important from day one. I designed and implemented a template versatile enough to accommodate various types of content while maintaining a familiar pattern for UI interaction and content delivery. Content editors also needed an intuitive way to construct evergreen content without breaking the established consistency, therefore it was important to design guardrails in the CMS field implementation.

  - title: Results & Impact
    description: Our team deployed a fully functional and responsive multi-regional travel website. The staff at the Olympic Peninsula Visitor's Bureau, who was instrumental in the project, reported a significant increase in evergreen content primarily due to ease of use. The amount of time it took to publish new content decreased by hours. Annual surveys sent out by the Visitor's Bureau showed a qualitative increase in user satisfaction, which was supported by a drop in bounce rate, and an increase in click-through rate for partner backlinks.
