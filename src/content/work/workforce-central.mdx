  # - title: Defining Metrics
  #   description: To effectively deliver and track these goals, metrics like number of reports downloaded, time on site, bounce rate, and number of monthly support calls were defined.
  - title: Personas & Stakeholders
    component: Understand
    description: We identified three target personas, their goals, motivations, and pain points. Young and middle-aged adults from marginalized communities were surveyed about their job seeking process across several regional workforce development agencies. I conducted on-site field studies, asking employees about their internal process and mapped touch-points for support and customer service tasks to better inform the design solution.

  - title: Mid-Fidelity Prototypes
    component: Explore
    description: I created mid fidelity wireframes and iterated on them through a series of feedback sessions. The wireframes were designed to articulate changes in information architecture, and served as paper prototypes for user testing. Next, I developed working prototypes and delivered to stakeholders for hands-on user acceptance testing.

    component: Materialize
    description: To highlight WorkForce Central’s Housing and Employment Navigator Model, a standalone single-page website was designed and developed. Each section included the ability to download the full report, which was identified as a primary goal of the feature. Additionally, each section included interactive data visualization to enrich the overall experience and increase the speed to insight for the user.
