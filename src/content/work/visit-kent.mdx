  title: Visit Kent – Weekend Warriors - Adventure Awaits
description: >-
  Visit Kent helps visitors from all over the world discover and explore the Pacific Northwest. Their website was overdue for a complete overhaul. More than 250 pages of content and no search function delivered a poor experience and contributed to a loss of revenue. A custom-coded CMS made it cumbersome to upload content taking away valuable time from staff and the site didn’t capture the authenticity of Kent's diverse community.

  - title: Assessing The Current State
    component: Understand
    description: To better understand the complexity of the website, We crawled the existing site for a full picture of the information and interaction hierarchy. Roughly 15% of page links were broken and there was a deeply nested information architecture. These findings formed the base of the new IA that we delivered to stakeholders.

  - title: Goals & Metrics
    component: Understand
    description: Our team held a series of workshops with staff and committee members to gain a better understanding of the overall goals of the organization and gain perspective on the audience. The economic development team sought a fresh and responsive site showcasing the undiscovered and unexpected while also putting visitors first. Hoteliers wanted an easy way for visitors to book their stay. At a high level, "heads in beds" was determined to be a major metric to track; though this was dependent on a subjective analysis of other quantitative metrics like bounce rates, conversion rates, and unique website visitors.

  - title: Traveling Personas
    component: Understand
    description: Conducted research on Kent as a destination and on the user's motivations for visiting the website. Our goal was to understand user behavior and planning strategies employed before making hotel reservations for various destinations. Parents were of particular interest, as were people in the 30-50 age range who were more likely to plan before traveling.

  - title: Design Iterations
    component: Explore
    description: Working with our content team, I designed simplified action-inspiring topline navigation and a three-columned layout for evergreen content. I orchestrated several feedback sessions using InVision and subsequent design iterations, starting with a newly proposed site map, information architecture, and working through wireframes of each section. Between the advisory committee and agency staff, over 300 comments were received and considered across 3 rounds of design revisions.

  - title: Care Above The Fold
    component: Explore
    description: Key strategic goals were to reduce the bounce rate and increase repeat visitors. Our early testing with users indicated that intercomponent, aspirational evergreen content was critical in achieving these goals. Therefore, care was placed above the fold, within the boundaries of the user's initial frame of view.

  - title: Colorful Interactions
    component: Materialize
    description: I designed and implemented an interactive map showcasing top destinations around Kent. Each glyph included hover and click states that led to a primary call to action. I worked with the content team and stakeholders to build and test this feature.

  - title: Simplified Navigation
    component: Materialize
    description: In user testing, we found that both users and content owners desired a simplified menu structure. When asked to navigate a complete page and then move to another, most utilized the footer navigation. The design is aimed at maintaining visual hierarchy while simplifying with subtle interactions and animations.

  - title: Story Templates
    component: Materialize
    description: The story templates feature was designed with both the end-user and content writers in mind. We wanted to make it easy for content editors to add fresh content while giving the end-user a delightful experience. We tested our story template with users and found a mix of an interactive map, numbered list modality, and aspirational imagery was received the best.

  - title: Hotel listings
    component: Materialize
    description: I worked with the lodging committee to gather requirements for a custom API implementation for the lodging directory. I designed and implemented a masonry layout with each card component pulling information from the TripAdvisor API. The primary call to action was to redirect users to the hotel's website using a new tab.

  - title: Results & Impact
    description: Our team tracked several metrics over the course of a year. After an initial 3 month period of transition, the telemetry showed roughly a 20% decrease in bounce rate, a 5% increase in unique visitors, and Visit Kent's hotel partners saw an increase in backlinks directly from the Visit Kent website. As a result, our agency was awarded a contract extension for managing and maintaining the website.
