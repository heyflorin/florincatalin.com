  title: Visit Kent – Weekend Warriors - Adventure Awaits
description: >-
  Visit Kent’s helps visitors from all over world discover and explore the Pacific Northwest. Their website was overdue for a complete overhaul. More than 250 pages of content and no search function delivered a poor experience and contributed to loss of revenue. A custom-coded CMS made it cumbersome to upload content taking away valuable time from staff and the site didn’t capture the authenticity of Kent's diverse community.Visit Kent’s helps visitors from all over world discover and explore the Pacific Northwest.
